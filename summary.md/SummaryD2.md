1. Dataset Overview
    - Features: 19
    - Rows: 403 / 380 (Check)
    - Target: Glyhb (Create a new target variable row that classifies diabetes, (need to know what glyhb is))
    - Missing Values: Minimal for most columns. bp.2s, bp.2d have high missing values (maybe take out)
    - Source: Biostat department from Vanderbilt
2. Correlations
    - glyhb and stab.glu are pretty correlated and the rest of variables have correlation amongst eachother. Could be good for either Decision Trees or LDA
    - Need to understand the rows a bit more.
